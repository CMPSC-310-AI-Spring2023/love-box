### Timeline

| ----------- | ----------- |
|   dates    |    task 1   |

### Hardware 

- Arduino board

- springs
- box with a slot
- a gadget that can push forward
- a light sensor or temperature sensor
- a speaker

## Arduino Project

A clown gift box. When it senses light gets dim or temperature gets high(i.e it checks someone's existence), the box will be open and a clown will jump out with a speaker making clown's sharp laughter

## Agent

Explain the characteristics/attributes of your agent, what makes it an agent (within the discussed course content), what makes it rational, what type of an agent it is, and what is its environment task (PEAS).

It's an agent because:

- it acts with the environment: the temperature difference or the light difference
- it's changing
- take action i.e. let the clown inside the box pop out after receiving the right signal

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

The physical part of this program is hard. Because I need to customize a box that could feed all the requirements. The point of this box is to make the clown inside jump out. However, it has to be scary enough, which means the clown will pop out in flash other than little by little. For this reason, I chose a spring to accomplish this part. It, unfortunately, introduces another problem: How to keep the spring squeezed so that it could release appropriately. My solution would be make a special box topping so that it could be stuck in slot. It will fix the springs. Then Arduino board interact with top so that it could release the spring after Arduino board senses environment changes. However, things change. It's Valentine day so I suddenly decided 

For the software part, coding is an inevitable challenge where I have to learn the Arduino board from scratch. Also, the communication between software and hardware replies on physics and engineering knowledge, which is what I am lack of.

Also, another challenge is adaptivity. I didn't get some material like spring as I planned so I had a hard time to find a decent way to make the jack working and popping out in an appropriate way. Finally, I found the cardboard did a good job on it. Also, instead of popping out, the jack shows up by flipping the cardboard.

## Ethical Benefits and Implications

In this section, drawing on class discussions and readings, answer the following questions

1. Any toy company or Halloween company. It will be a good gift.

2. Young generation who wanna prank their friends

3. Any person will heart disease

4. The spring may pop out too much and make the inside material of this box fly to the sky. The person who is pranked may get aggressive and there may be a fight in this lab

5. The spring part should be produced and tested before other parts to make sure the spring is fixed appropriately. For the latter, there is nothing to do :>

## Team Work

I AM a team myself
